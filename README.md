# Securing API with Duende Server (Identity Server 6)

In this project we will take an API application with authentication using .NET identity and we will modify it to use Identity Server(Duende Server 6) for authentication and authorization. Duende Server 6 uses Razor Pages as default UI pages and we will see how to add login logout and register functionality.
